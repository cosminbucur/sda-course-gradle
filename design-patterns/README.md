#### SOLID
##### single responsibility principle
A class should have a single responsibility, where a responsibility is nothing but a reason to change.

    DONE - single responsibility principle

##### open-closed principle
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

    DONE - DRY principle

#### YAGNI (You Aint Gonna Need It)

#### Law of Demeter

#### Clean Code

##### Low coupling

Coupling is a measure of how strongly one element is connected to, has knowledge of, 
or relies on other elements. Low coupling is an evaluative pattern that dictates how 
to assign responsibilities to support
- lower dependency between the classes,
- change in one class having lower impact on other classes,
- higher reuse potential.

##### High cohesion
High cohesion is an evaluative pattern that attempts to keep objects appropriately focused, 
manageable and understandable. High cohesion is generally used in support of low coupling. 
High cohesion means that the responsibilities of a given element are strongly related and
highly focused. Breaking programs into classes and subsystems is an example of activities
that increase the cohesive properties of a system. Alternatively, low cohesion is a situation 
in which a given element has too many unrelated responsibilities. Elements with low cohesion 
often suffer from being hard to comprehend, reuse, maintain and change.
